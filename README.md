# Pedestrian Safety System 🚦

A smart crosswalk system that enhances pedestrian safety using IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and NeoPixel LEDs.

## 🛠️ Features
- Detects pedestrians at entry, center, and exit using IR and ultrasonic sensors
- Controls crosswalk lighting with NeoPixel LEDs (Green, Orange, Red)
- Activates a buzzer in emergency situations (simultaneous vehicle and pedestrian detection)
- Controls smart streetlight brightness based on detection
- Real-time pedestrian and vehicle monitoring

## 🧰 Hardware Used
- ESP32 / Arduino Uno
- TCRT5000 IR Sensors
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors
- PIR Sensors
- WS2812B NeoPixel LED
- Buzzer
- Potentiometers (for simulation)

## 📦 Folder Structure
- `Arduino_Code/`: Contains the main `.ino` file for the system.
- `Schematics/`: Circuit diagram and connection details.
- `Images/`: Photos of the prototype (if any).
